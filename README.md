# search
my first search engine!


the add stoplist and add document use-cases are not really user initiated
actions.  they are part of initializing the inverted index (which happens
before the user "arrives".

it looks like you uncovered zero attributes.  in order to function the program
must need to retain some information.  think about what information a search
engine has to keep track of.

one place to start is with the services. in order for each service to perform
its actions what information does it need?  for example, consider "Retrieve
documents with a certain word."

The directory `testing` includes a simple test case.  Note that the script 
`test0` assumes that your code is in its parent directory.
